# Server Setup Notes
Notes for setting up a Linux Server (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) to run a N-Tier Web application with the following components:
* **MongoDB** (3.x) NoSQL Document Database Server (Port 27017)
* **uWSGI** Python Application Server (to Host Django REST API)
* **NGINX** Reverse Proxy and Web Server (To serve both the API and Client App [Angular] over a single http port [80])

## uWSGI Installation and configuration
uWSGI is an implimetation of the **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)** Specification. It provides a universial interface 
between a given Web Server (*NGINX* for this setup) and a given Python-based Web Application (*Django REST Framework* 
for this setup).

### Install and Configure VirtualEnv and VirtualEnvWrapper
An isolated runtime environment will need be establised on the server for hosting the Python-based Django REST API Application.  This accomplished using the **VirtualEnv** tool with the **VirtualEnvWrapper** add-on.  The Virtual Environment allows the Application's depencies (Libraries, Frameworks, etc.) to be managed independently of any other Applications that may be provisioned on the same server instance. For example, two Web Applications can run side-by-side with different versions of the Django Framework.
